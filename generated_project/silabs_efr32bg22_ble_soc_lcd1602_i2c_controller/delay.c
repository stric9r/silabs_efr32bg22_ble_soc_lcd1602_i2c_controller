  * SDK dependencies:
  *   sl_udelay.h   Silicon Labs udelay service
  *                 platform/service/udelay/inc/sl_udelay.h
  *                 Gecko SDK component: udelay (tested: 4.4.5)
  *
  * sl_udelay_wait() is a blocking busy-wait implemented in assembly for
  * Cortex-M. It is safe to call from any non-interrupt context. The udelay
  * component requires no explicit initialisation; delay_init() is a no-op.
  * Do not call delay_ms() with large values from time-critical paths.
